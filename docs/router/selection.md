# Which Router should I use?

React Resource Router provides three kinds of routers which should be quite familiar to anyone who has used `react-router` previously. These are the core [`Router`](/api/components#router), the [`StaticRouter`](/api/components#staticrouter) for use on the server and the [`MemoryRouter`](/api/components#memoryrouter) for use in tests. Please check the [API](/api) docs for more detailed information about these components.
